This is a terminal-based application made with Python that lets you interact with AI models in your console. The project uses a custom API by [@PawanOsman](https://github.com/PawanOsman/ChatGPT) to access their AI models, such as `cosmosrp-8k`, to respond to user queries.

## Features

- **Real-time AI interaction**: Talk to the AI directly from the terminal and receive responses based on your input.
- **No API key required**: The Pawan API does not require an API key for access, allowing you to use their AI models without any limits.
- **Rich terminal interface**: Enhanced the terminal experience with visually appealing text formatting using the `rich` library.
